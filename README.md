Hello :)

This is a simple project I did a while ago mapping local historical events. I rennovated it recently to move away from a manual approach to a data scraping approach. I have added data from Wikidata (Q13418847) and am going to add some more from different sources hopefully.

There are currently a bit more than 8000 events marked on the map with barely any duplicates as far as I can tell.
